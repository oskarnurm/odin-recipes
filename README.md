# odin-recipes

The website will consist of a main index page, which will have links to a few recipes (currently only one). The website wonâ€™t look very pretty, but this project is designed to build my HTML skills; I will revisit it in the future to style it up with CSS.

## TODO
- [X] Pretty landing page
- [ ] Add more recipes
- [ ] Style recipes
- [ ] Animate recipe selection on the landing page
